🗂️ Forex Simulation App — Development Roadmap
Stage 1 — Project Setup & Structure

📁 Files/Directories:

Create folders: app/, public/, views/, config/, routes/

Create index.php as the main entry

Create config/config.php

🎯 Goal:

Initialize project folder

Set up a clean base file structure

Load configurations and test initial routing

Stage 2 — Core Configuration & Utilities

📁 Files:

config/config.php

app/helpers/Utils.php

app/helpers/Format.php

🎯 Goal:

Add constants (e.g. BASE_URL, app name, timezone)

Add helper functions like:

random number generator for simulation

format currency and timestamps

Ensure index.php includes the helpers and config

Stage 3 — Market Simulation Engine

📁 Files:

app/services/PriceGenerator.php
